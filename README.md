# pokutuna-plugins

Claude Code plugins by pokutuna.

## Installation

Add this marketplace to Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/pokutuna/claude-plugins
```

Then install plugins:

```
/plugin install <plugin-name>@pokutuna-plugins
```

## Recommendation

Install plugins with **user scope** (default), then enable per-project via `<project>/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "runpod@pokutuna-plugins": true
  }
}
```

Project-scoped installation has known bugs that prevent installing the same plugin to multiple projects:
- [#14202](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14202) - Project-scoped plugins incorrectly detected as installed globally
- [#20593](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/20593) - Plugin install matches wrong marketplace when same plugin name exists in multiple marketplaces
