# Colab → RunPod Network Volume Model Upload

Downloading large models during GPU instance runtime wastes billing time.
Use Colab to download from HuggingFace and upload to RunPod Network Volume via S3-compatible API.

## Prerequisites

### Colab Secrets

- `HF_TOKEN`: HuggingFace access token
- `RUNPOD_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: RunPod Storage Access Key ID
- `RUNPOD_STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: RunPod Storage Secret Access Key

### RunPod Storage Settings

Get from https://console.runpod.io/user/storage "S3 Compatible API Commands" Example:
```
aws s3 ls --region xxx --endpoint-url https://s3api-xxx.runpod.io s3://your-volume-id/
```

## Steps

1. Open Colab notebook:
   https://colab.research.google.com/github/pokutuna/claude-plugins/blob/main/runpod/skills/prepare-model-upload/hf-to-runpod-storage.ipynb
2. Configure Colab Secrets (🔑 icon in left sidebar)
3. Enter model names and volume settings, then run

## Notes

### Sync Limitations

`aws s3 sync` may fail on large volumes:
> fatal error: Error during pagination: The same next token was received twice: ...

Use `aws s3 cp --recursive` instead (no delta transfer).

### Upload Failures

If `upload failed` occurs, retry with `--checksum-algorithm=CRC32C`.

## Notebook Structure

The notebook has separate cells:
1. **Environment Setup** - Loads secrets from Colab (run once)
2. **Settings** - Model names and storage settings (user configures this)
3. **Download and Upload** - Main execution
4. **Troubleshooting cells** - For retry scenarios

## Response Instructions

When user provides model names or aws cli command examples, output code snippets that can be directly copy-pasted into Colab cells.

### When user provides model name(s)

Output a ready-to-paste Settings cell:

```python
# Settings

# HuggingFace models (USER/REPOSITORY format, multiple allowed)
HF_MODELS = [
    "USER_PROVIDED_MODEL",  # parsed from user input
]

# RunPod Storage (copy from https://console.runpod.io/user/storage)
REGION = ""  # @param {type:"string"}
ENDPOINT_URL = ""  # @param {type:"string"}
BUCKET = ""  # @param {type:"string"}
```

### When user provides aws cli command example

Parse the command and output a ready-to-paste Settings cell with values filled:

Example input:
```
aws s3 ls --region us-east-1 --endpoint-url https://s3api-xxxxxx.runpod.io s3://abc123def456/
```

Output:
```python
# Settings

# HuggingFace models (USER/REPOSITORY format, multiple allowed)
HF_MODELS = [
    "",  # Add your model here, e.g., "Qwen/Qwen3-8B"
]

# RunPod Storage (parsed from aws cli command)
REGION = "us-east-1"  # @param {type:"string"}
ENDPOINT_URL = "https://s3api-xxxxxx.runpod.io"  # @param {type:"string"}
BUCKET = "abc123def456"  # @param {type:"string"}
```

### When user provides both model name(s) and aws cli command

Combine both into a complete Settings cell ready to run.

## Examples

User: "I want to put Qwen3-8B on my runpod network volume"

1. Provide Colab notebook URL
2. Guide Colab Secrets setup
3. Output Settings cell with model name filled:
   ```python
   HF_MODELS = [
       "Qwen/Qwen3-8B",
   ]
   ```

User: "aws s3 ls --region us-east-1 --endpoint-url https://s3api-xxx.runpod.io s3://my-bucket/"

Parse and output Settings cell with storage values filled.
