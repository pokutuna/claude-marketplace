# statusline-wrapper.sh - Tee statusLine stdin into the state file, then pass it
#                         through to the user's original statusLine command unchanged.
#
# Overview:
#   Claude Code feeds the statusLine command a JSON blob on stdin that includes
#   `rate_limits` (5h / 7d usage %) and `cost` (this session's cumulative cost).
#   This is the ONLY hook surface that receives them, and it rides on the normal
#   response — so capturing it here costs zero extra quota.
#
#   This wrapper:
#     1. reads stdin once
#     2. saves the figures into the state file (see layout below)
#     3. replays the exact same stdin to the original statusLine command
#   stdout / stderr / exit code of the original command are passed through untouched.
#   If there is no original command, nothing is printed — a user who had no
#   statusLine keeps an empty one (Claude Code has no built-in default to fall back to).
#
# State file (git-config; ${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/cc-limit-usage.conf):
#   One file, sectioned by scope. rate_limits are account-wide (every session
#   reports the same 5h/7d %) so they live in [global]; cost.total_cost_usd is
#   per-session (it never adds up across sessions) so it lives in [session "<id>"].
#   Key prefix marks the kind: `used-*` = measured (written here), `limit-*` =
#   threshold (written by guard.sh set/clear). The two writers never share a key,
#   so co-locating them in one section is safe.
#
#     [global]
#         used-5h = 42                 ; measured quota %  (this wrapper)
#         used-7d = 18                 ; measured quota %  (this wrapper)
#         reset-5h = 1780417800        ; window reset epoch
#         reset-7d = 1780999999
#         epoch = <epoch>              ; quota snapshot last-updated
#         schema = 1                   ; snapshot format generation
#         limit-5h = 90                ; --global thresholds (guard.sh set)
#     [session "<id>"]
#         used-usd = 4.52              ; measured session cost (this wrapper)
#         epoch = <epoch>              ; cost snapshot last-updated
#         limit-usd = 5                ; thresholds (guard.sh set)
#
# This wrapper writes ONLY `used-*`, `reset-*`, `epoch`, and `schema`. It never
# touches `limit-*`. session_id is used verbatim (subsection names are
# case-sensitive — never normalize it).
#
# Usage (set into settings.json statusLine.command by the setup skill):
#   statusline-wrapper.sh '<original statusLine command>'
